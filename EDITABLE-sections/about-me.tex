    I studied Anthropology at Durham University, England, where I took part in projects using evolutionary theory to understand human cultural diversity. Before this I worked as a cinematographer for five years, specialising in time-lapse and slow-motion techniques. I have now completed a PhD in Biology at the University of Oxford. I have a wide range of interests that include open software and data, data visualisation, information design, cultural diversity, the evolution of language and communication, Bayesian inference, research methodology and the philosophy of science.
