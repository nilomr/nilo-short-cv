    I studied Anthropology at Durham University, England, where I became interested in using evolutionary theory to understand cultural diversity. Before this I worked as a cinematographer for five years, specialising in time-lapse and slow-motion techniques. I have now completed a PhD in Biology at the University of Oxford. I have a range of interests that include open software and data, bioacoustics, data visualisation, information design, cultural diversity, the evolution of language and communication, maps, Bayesian inference, and the philosophy of science.
